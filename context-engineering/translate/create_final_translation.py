        "content": "Today I'm sharing a groundbreaking research concept that's made it to Nature's cover: the integration of reinforcement learning and Kalman filtering. This Nature cover story features Swift, an autonomous drone racing system that achieved competitive performance comparable to human world champions in drone racing by combining reinforcement learning and Kalman filtering, setting the fastest recorded race time. This remarkable achievement stems from the numerous advantages of this combination. Specifically, reinforcement learning can leverage the high-precision state estimation provided by Kalman filtering to make more informed and precise decisions, thereby improving decision accuracy and system robustness while enhancing real-time performance and computational efficiency, maintaining stability in the face of noise, uncertainty, and external disturbances. This combined strategy holds significant research value for those working on papers. I've compiled 10 cutting-edge papers on reinforcement learning + Kalman filtering with open-source code for easy reproduction."

        "content": "Late at night, you're scrolling through short videos while algorithms precisely push pet videos you might be interested in; in the morning, your smart speaker reports weather and news based on your daily habits; at work, Excel automatically identifies outliers in your data... Behind these seemingly magical scenarios lies a mathematical concept - matrix rank. Like an invisible scalpel, it can dissect the essential structure of data and compress redundant information; it's both the 'decision-maker' for linear equation solutions and the 'information filter' for artificial intelligence. This article will guide you through the maze of equations, spaces, data compression, and neural networks to unveil the mystery of 'rank'. Rank tells you how much truly independent information exists in your data and what's redundant 'noise'."

        "title": "Science Sub-journal: How Social Influence is Built? A Cognitive Perspective",
        "content": "Abstract: While occupying a central position in social networks brings numerous advantages, how certain individuals climb to influential positions remains an unsolved mystery. A joint Stanford University and Brown University team tracked 187 college freshmen to study the formation and evolution of their social networks, discovering that those who ultimately achieved high influence positions could accurately perceive the abstract structure of networks (such as community and clique distributions) during the early formation stages, while knowledge of specific friendship relationships was unrelated to influence growth. Only after network stabilization did high-influence individuals demonstrate precise grasp of individual relationships. This study reveals for the first time the crucial role of a 'macro-first, micro-second' hierarchical cognitive strategy in accumulating social influence."
