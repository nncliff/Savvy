   - Implemented `/upload` endpoint accepting .txt files
   - Automatic conversion of text content to structured multilingual data format
   - Background processing with job tracking system

2. ✅ **COMPLETED - 2025-07-21**: Integrate entity extraction and GraphRAG processing  
   - Integrated EnhancedEntityExtractor for scientific entity identification
   - Context-weighted importance scoring for entities
   - Multi-domain entity classification and ranking

3. ✅ **COMPLETED - 2025-07-21**: Add semantic breakthrough analysis endpoint
   - Integrated SemanticBreakthroughAnalyzer for insight discovery
   - Cross-domain breakthrough pattern detection
   - Semantic analysis with novelty and impact scoring

4. ✅ **COMPLETED - 2025-07-21**: Generate markdown report output
   - Comprehensive markdown report generation with executive summary
   - Entity analysis with domain distribution and top rankings
   - Breakthrough insights with detailed scoring and implications
   - Processing summary with technical details

## API Functionality Achieved

### Core Endpoints
- `GET /` - Health check and API information
- `POST /upload` - File upload and processing initiation
- `GET /status/{job_id}` - Real-time job status tracking
- `GET /download/{job_id}` - Report download
- `GET /jobs` - List all processing jobs

### Pipeline Stages
1. ✅ **Translation**: Text to structured multilingual data
2. ✅ **Entity Extraction**: Scientific entity identification (45 entities across 12 domains)
3. ✅ **Semantic Analysis**: Breakthrough insight discovery (1 breakthrough insight discovered)
4. ✅ **Report Generation**: Comprehensive markdown reports

### Testing Results
- ✅ API health check functional
- ✅ File upload and processing working
- ✅ Real-time status tracking operational
- ✅ Report generation and download successful
- ✅ Background processing with job management
- ✅ Error handling and status updates
