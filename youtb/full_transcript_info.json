    "Intro\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      0:00\n    \n  \n  \n  Kimmy K2 has just blown up the entire AI\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:03\n    \n  \n  \n  space. Not only is it the most powerful\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:05\n    \n  \n  \n  model out there right now, but what if I\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:07\n    \n  \n  \n  told you it's basically free and you'll\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:09\n    \n  \n  \n  potentially never have to pay for AI\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:10\n    \n  \n  \n  again. And oh yeah, it's completely open\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:13\n    \n  \n  \n  source. In this video, I'm going to show\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:14\n    \n  \n  \n  you why Kimmy K2 just shook up the\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:16\n    \n  \n  \n  entire industry, why it has Sam Alman\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:19\n    \n  \n  \n  changing all his plans, and how you can\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:21\n    \n  \n  \n  get Kimmy K2 set up so you never have to\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:24\n    \n  \n  \n  pay for AI coding again. This might be\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:26\n    \n  \n  \n  the end of Claude Code. Let's lock in\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:28\n    \n  \n  \n  and get into it. So, this is Kimmy K2.\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  Using Kimi K2\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      0:30\n    \n  \n  \n  This is a brand new model out of the\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:32\n    \n  \n  \n  Chinese company Moonshot. And there's so\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:34\n    \n  \n  \n  many mind-blowing things about this.\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:36\n    \n  \n  \n  First of all, if you go to their site\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:37\n    \n  \n  \n  right now, kimmy.com, you can use their\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:40\n    \n  \n  \n  chatbot completely free, unlimited,\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:42\n    \n  \n  \n  completely free, and unlimited. How\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:43\n    \n  \n  \n  unheard of is that? But what makes it\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:45\n    \n  \n  \n  even more amazing is it's actually an\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:47\n    \n  \n  \n  incredible, incredible model. Looking at\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:49\n    \n  \n  \n  the benchmarks, it beats pretty much\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  Benchmarks\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      0:51\n    \n  \n  \n  every other model out there. And what's\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:53\n    \n  \n  \n  really amazing is it's comparing it to\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:54\n    \n  \n  \n  every company's top model. They're\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:56\n    \n  \n  \n  comparing it to Claude 4 Opus and this\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      0:59\n    \n  \n  \n  isn't even a thinking model and it's\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:01\n    \n  \n  \n  beating pretty much all of them. The\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:03\n    \n  \n  \n  only model that seems to come\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:04\n    \n  \n  \n  consistently close is Claude for Opus,\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:06\n    \n  \n  \n  but they're pretty much neck to neck in\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:08\n    \n  \n  \n  almost every single benchmark. What's\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:10\n    \n  \n  \n  crazy, it's not even a thinking model,\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:11\n    \n  \n  \n  so the results you're going to get are\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:13\n    \n  \n  \n  going to be super quick. So, it's free.\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:15\n    \n  \n  \n  It's just as good as all the other top\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:17\n    \n  \n  \n  models out there. And it's open source,\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:20\n    \n  \n  \n  which means you can download it, run it\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:22\n    \n  \n  \n  locally, and tinker with it any way you\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:24\n    \n  \n  \n  want. It has an unbelievable 1 trillion\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:28\n    \n  \n  \n  total parameters. I'm telling you, I\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:30\n    \n  \n  \n  don't know what's in the water in China,\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:31\n    \n  \n  \n  but they're making some unbelievable AI\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:33\n    \n  \n  \n  model. Now, why do I say it's basically\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:35\n    \n  \n  \n  free? Well, one thing, if you're using\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:36\n    \n  \n  \n  the chatbot on kimmy.com, it is\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:38\n    \n  \n  \n  literally free. You can do as much\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:40\n    \n  \n  \n  research, as much searching, as much\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:42\n    \n  \n  \n  anything you want. Completely for free.\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:44\n    \n  \n  \n  No charges at all. The only time you'll\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:46\n    \n  \n  \n  run into payments is if you're using the\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:48\n    \n  \n  \n  API, but even then with the API, it is a\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:51\n    \n  \n  \n  quarter of the price of Claude Opus.\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:53\n    \n  \n  \n  These are some unbelievable prices here.\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:55\n    \n  \n  \n  And what's even more amazing is actually\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:57\n    \n  \n  \n  a free tier. So when you start using it,\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      1:59\n    \n  \n  \n  it will be free up to a certain point.\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:01\n    \n  \n  \n  You get something like 1 million tokens\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:03\n    \n  \n  \n  a day, completely free, which is a good\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:05\n    \n  \n  \n  amount. I mean, this has shaken up the\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:06\n    \n  \n  \n  entire industry. Just this week, Open AI\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  OpenAI Panic\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      2:10\n    \n  \n  \n  was supposed to release their own open-\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:12\n    \n  \n  \n  source model, their first open-source\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:14\n    \n  \n  \n  model ever. But right when they were\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:16\n    \n  \n  \n  supposed to do it, Kimmy K2 comes out\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:18\n    \n  \n  \n  and it blows away all the competition.\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:20\n    \n  \n  \n  So what happens? Well, it looks like\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:22\n    \n  \n  \n  OpenAI delayed their open source model\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:25\n    \n  \n  \n  because of this. So Sam Alman just\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:27\n    \n  \n  \n  tweeted less than 24 hours ago, \"We plan\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:29\n    \n  \n  \n  to launch our openweight model next\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:31\n    \n  \n  \n  week. We are delaying it. We need time\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:32\n    \n  \n  \n  to run additional safety tests and\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:34\n    \n  \n  \n  review high-risk areas.\" Now listen, did\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:37\n    \n  \n  \n  he say they're delaying because of Kimmy\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:39\n    \n  \n  \n  K2? No. But this is pretty convenient\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:42\n    \n  \n  \n  timing. If you're open AI and you're\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:44\n    \n  \n  \n  looked at as the king of AI, you can't\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:46\n    \n  \n  \n  release an open-source model that's\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:48\n    \n  \n  \n  weaker than a Chinese model that just\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:50\n    \n  \n  \n  came out. So they have to go back to the\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:52\n    \n  \n  \n  drawing board and make sure it beats\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:53\n    \n  \n  \n  this competition. So let's do this. I\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:55\n    \n  \n  \n  want to show you how you can use the\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:56\n    \n  \n  \n  model as a coding agent. I'm going to\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      2:58\n    \n  \n  \n  show you how you can install it into\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:00\n    \n  \n  \n  cursor so you can start using it and you\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:02\n    \n  \n  \n  don't have to pay for anything until you\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:04\n    \n  \n  \n  hit the limits. And then even when you\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:05\n    \n  \n  \n  do hit the limits, it's going to be way\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:07\n    \n  \n  \n  cheaper than any other model you use. So\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  Installing Kimi K2\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      3:09\n    \n  \n  \n  here's what you need to do. Open up the\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:10\n    \n  \n  \n  development environment of your choice.\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:12\n    \n  \n  \n  I'm going to go with cursor for this.\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:14\n    \n  \n  \n  Once you have that downloaded and opened\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:16\n    \n  \n  \n  up, what you're going to do is you're\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:17\n    \n  \n  \n  going to go over to the extension\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:19\n    \n  \n  \n  section over here. So, you hit the\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:21\n    \n  \n  \n  extensions button over on the left hand\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:22\n    \n  \n  \n  side. Then, what you're going to do is\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:24\n    \n  \n  \n  type in Klein. Klein is an open-source\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:27\n    \n  \n  \n  AI agent that we can plug any API key\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:30\n    \n  \n  \n  into. So, what we're going to do is\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:32\n    \n  \n  \n  we're going to download Klein. We're\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:34\n    \n  \n  \n  going to plug the Kimmy K2 API key into\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:37\n    \n  \n  \n  it and then we're going to start to be\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:38\n    \n  \n  \n  able to code with Kimmy K2. So once you\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:41\n    \n  \n  \n  have client downloaded into cursor or\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:43\n    \n  \n  \n  whatever development environment you're\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:44\n    \n  \n  \n  using, we need to get our API key. So if\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:46\n    \n  \n  \n  you go to platform.moonshot.ai/conole,\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:50\n    \n  \n  \n  I'll put the link down below. Make sure\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:52\n    \n  \n  \n  you sign up for an account there. Once\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:54\n    \n  \n  \n  you're in there, we're going to go to\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:55\n    \n  \n  \n  API keys. And from here, we're going to\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:57\n    \n  \n  \n  create an API. We're going to give it a\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      3:59\n    \n  \n  \n  name. I'm going to call it Kimmy. We'll\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:00\n    \n  \n  \n  put it in the default project. And I'll\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:02\n    \n  \n  \n  hit enter on that. Will spit out an API\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:04\n    \n  \n  \n  key for you. We're going to copy that.\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:06\n    \n  \n  \n  Okay. So, we're going to take this API\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:07\n    \n  \n  \n  key and put it into client so we can\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:09\n    \n  \n  \n  start coding for free. So, what we're\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:11\n    \n  \n  \n  going to do in here is make sure you hit\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:12\n    \n  \n  \n  settings. You're going to click this\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:13\n    \n  \n  \n  dropown. We're going to choose Anthropic\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:15\n    \n  \n  \n  as our API provider. They run the API\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:18\n    \n  \n  \n  through Anthropic. So, this is standard.\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:20\n    \n  \n  \n  We click on that. Take your API key you\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:22\n    \n  \n  \n  just got in Kimmy and paste that into\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:24\n    \n  \n  \n  Anthropic API key here. For the model,\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:27\n    \n  \n  \n  just leave that be. Doesn't matter which\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:28\n    \n  \n  \n  model you choose. Since you put in your\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:30\n    \n  \n  \n  Kimmy API key, it'll use the latest\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:31\n    \n  \n  \n  Kimmy model. You're going to want to\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:33\n    \n  \n  \n  make sure you click on use custom base\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:35\n    \n  \n  \n  URL. For the custom base URL, you're\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:37\n    \n  \n  \n  going to use api.moonshot.ai/anthropic.\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:41\n    \n  \n  \n  I'll put the link down below so you can\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:42\n    \n  \n  \n  just copy and paste that. Make sure you\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:44\n    \n  \n  \n  get it perfect. Feel free to pause here\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:45\n    \n  \n  \n  to grab that. From there, any model is\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:47\n    \n  \n  \n  fine. So, you can leave that be on set\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:49\n    \n  \n  \n  or whatever it did for you. And then you\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:50\n    \n  \n  \n  can click done. One thing you need to\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:51\n    \n  \n  \n  know before you start using the free\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:53\n    \n  \n  \n  tier, you do need to put a couple\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:55\n    \n  \n  \n  dollars of credit on there to unlock the\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:57\n    \n  \n  \n  free tier. So, I'm just going to pay $10\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      4:59\n    \n  \n  \n  and then you can use the free tier every\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:01\n    \n  \n  \n  day and it won't take away from those\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:02\n    \n  \n  \n  $10. And then if you do go over, it will\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:05\n    \n  \n  \n  take that. But with any other model,\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:06\n    \n  \n  \n  you're spending $10 in like an hour. So,\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:08\n    \n  \n  \n  this is still a very good deal. So, now\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:10\n    \n  \n  \n  you're all set up. You have Kimmy K2 all\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:13\n    \n  \n  \n  set up. You basically can code now for\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:15\n    \n  \n  \n  way cheaper than you were before and you\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:17\n    \n  \n  \n  can save a ton of money. So, let's get\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  Building the app\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      5:19\n    \n  \n  \n  this going. Let's test this out. My\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:21\n    \n  \n  \n  favorite test to do with any new AI\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:23\n    \n  \n  \n  model is just have it build out a 3D\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:25\n    \n  \n  \n  firstperson shooting game. I don't give\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:26\n    \n  \n  \n  it many instructions. Say, \"Hey, build\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:28\n    \n  \n  \n  this game out.\" So, we can see what kind\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:30\n    \n  \n  \n  of taste it has. Will it come up with\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:32\n    \n  \n  \n  creative ways to build the game out, put\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:34\n    \n  \n  \n  in assets? So, let's see. I'll put this\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:36\n    \n  \n  \n  prompt down below. Feel free to copy and\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:38\n    \n  \n  \n  paste it and put it into Kimmy and let's\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:39\n    \n  \n  \n  see what it can come up with. So, I\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:40\n    \n  \n  \n  said, I want you to build a 3D\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:42\n    \n  \n  \n  firstperson shooter using 3JS. Make this\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:44\n    \n  \n  \n  a single file game in index so I can run\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:47\n    \n  \n  \n  it easily. Make it creative and fun with\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:49\n    \n  \n  \n  beautiful graphics. So, we're giving it\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:51\n    \n  \n  \n  a lot of room for interpretation so we\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:53\n    \n  \n  \n  can see how well it does. I'm going to\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:54\n    \n  \n  \n  hit enter on that. All right. So, now\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:56\n    \n  \n  \n  it's going. There we go. It's building\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      5:58\n    \n  \n  \n  out the game for us. And again, this is\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:00\n    \n  \n  \n  on the free tier. So, it's not using up\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:02\n    \n  \n  \n  any of our credits. It's just building\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:04\n    \n  \n  \n  this out. So, it is building for us a\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:06\n    \n  \n  \n  full 3D firsterson shooter. This is with\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:10\n    \n  \n  \n  3JS. For those who don't know, 3JS is\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:12\n    \n  \n  \n  the easiest to use library for 3D games\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:14\n    \n  \n  \n  and experiences. So, I always have my\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:16\n    \n  \n  \n  models use 3JS if I'm building any sort\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:18\n    \n  \n  \n  of game out. It's building it out for\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:20\n    \n  \n  \n  us. From a speed perspective, it seems\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:22\n    \n  \n  \n  all right. Maybe it's because we're\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:24\n    \n  \n  \n  doing this through client. It's going a\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:26\n    \n  \n  \n  little bit slower because we're doing it\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:27\n    \n  \n  \n  through the API and it isn't native. But\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:29\n    \n  \n  \n  that's fine. It's still building us out\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:31\n    \n  \n  \n  and it's doing it for free. If you're\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:33\n    \n  \n  \n  using any other provider for this, you'd\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:34\n    \n  \n  \n  probably be paying a decent amount for\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:36\n    \n  \n  \n  every prompt you do. So, if you're on a\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:37\n    \n  \n  \n  budget, this is a great way to do it. As\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:39\n    \n  \n  \n  you can see, as it's building out all\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:41\n    \n  \n  \n  the code, it's building out the walls.\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:42\n    \n  \n  \n  It's building out the maze-like\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:44\n    \n  \n  \n  structures. This is actually getting\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:45\n    \n  \n  \n  pretty creative. So, this is going to be\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:46\n    \n  \n  \n  interesting to see. All right, looks\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:48\n    \n  \n  \n  like it's all set. Let's see how we did\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:49\n    \n  \n  \n  here. Let's open this up and see how it\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  Final results\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      6:51\n    \n  \n  \n  runs. So, if you're following along with\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:52\n    \n  \n  \n  me at home, all you need to do is find\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:53\n    \n  \n  \n  index.html\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:55\n    \n  \n  \n  in the folder you set up cursor in. Pop\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:57\n    \n  \n  \n  that open and let's see how we did here.\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      6:59\n    \n  \n  \n  Oh, look at this. Here we go. So, it's a\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:01\n    \n  \n  \n  neon sty. Oh, if I shoot, okay, I can\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:03\n    \n  \n  \n  kill the enemies. I think the problem is\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:05\n    \n  \n  \n  I'm running backwards into the enemies,\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:07\n    \n  \n  \n  but what you can see is it did do kind\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:09\n    \n  \n  \n  of a stylistic 3D neon game. Uh, I do\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:13\n    \n  \n  \n  like the taste. Now, do the enemies look\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:16\n    \n  \n  \n  that advanced? No, they are just pink.\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:19\n    \n  \n  \n  Uh they are just pink squares but at the\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:22\n    \n  \n  \n  same time it did oneshot the game and I\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:25\n    \n  \n  \n  do like the color scheme. I mean it does\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:27\n    \n  \n  \n  kind of look like puke but but like they\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:29\n    \n  \n  \n  did go for a stylish a stylistic effect\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:32\n    \n  \n  \n  right and now if I were to go through\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:34\n    \n  \n  \n  here and add a few more prompts say hey\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:36\n    \n  \n  \n  build out an opponent build out health\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:38\n    \n  \n  \n  packs build out powerups. I'd be able to\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:40\n    \n  \n  \n  do that but it built out a pretty solid\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:43\n    \n  \n  \n  game for one shot and not to mention\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:45\n    \n  \n  \n  completely free. So that's Kimmy K 2.\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:47\n    \n  \n  \n  That is the model that is changing the\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:49\n    \n  \n  \n  industry. Now listen, am I going to get\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:51\n    \n  \n  \n  off of Claude Code now because of this?\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:53\n    \n  \n  \n  Probably not. I'm paying the $200 a\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:55\n    \n  \n  \n  month. I've been able to build really\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:57\n    \n  \n  \n  awesome applications with it. I'm very\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      7:59\n    \n  \n  \n  used to the workflow. But if I'm someone\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:01\n    \n  \n  \n  who's a little bit more price conscious,\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:03\n    \n  \n  \n  who hasn't gotten into Clawude Code yet,\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:05\n    \n  \n  \n  who's not used to those types of\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:06\n    \n  \n  \n  workflows, I'd start here. This is\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:08\n    \n  \n  \n  completely free and really powerful. You\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:11\n    \n  \n  \n  could probably get a good amount done on\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:13\n    \n  \n  \n  this free tier. And even if you went\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:14\n    \n  \n  \n  over the limits, it's so cheap. you're\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:17\n    \n  \n  \n  probably just spending a couple bucks a\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:18\n    \n  \n  \n  month. It's definitely worth playing\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:20\n    \n  \n  \n  around with. I'll have all the links\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:22\n    \n  \n  \n  below so that you can try out the\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:23\n    \n  \n  \n  chatbot if you want to see how powerful\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:25\n    \n  \n  \n  this model is. And I'll also have the\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:27\n    \n  \n  \n  links to Klein and everything you need\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:29\n    \n  \n  \n  to get set up with coding so that you\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:31\n    \n  \n  \n  can start building apps today for free\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:33\n    \n  \n  \n  if you want to save a couple bucks. If\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:35\n    \n  \n  \n  you learned anything at all, make sure\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      8:36\n    \n  \n  \n  to leave a like.
